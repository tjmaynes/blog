I believe agile software methodologies, such as pair programming, test-driven development and continuous delivery, are powerful tools to help teams deliver valuable software to their customers.
Currently, spending more time with Rust, Kubernetes and making patches with softsynths.
Expertise Built software on many different agile software teams and projects using tools and frameworks like Typescript/React, Kotlin/Spring, Javascript/ExpressJS, Swift/Objective-C, Clojure, Elixir, Python and HTML/CSS.</description><content:encoded>Hi, my name is TJ Maynes and I’m a Senior Software Developer at VMware Pivotal Labs.

Expertise Built software on many different agile software teams and projects using tools and frameworks like Typescript/React, Kotlin/Spring, Javascript/ExpressJS, Swift/Objective-C, Clojure, Elixir, Python and HTML/CSS. Test-driven development, pair programming and implementing inclusive mob programming sessions. Automated testing strategies, such as e2e, integration and unit tests using tools like CypressJS, Jest, and Spring testing framework. Automating software delivery using tools like git, GNU Make, Bash scripts, Docker and Kubernetes. Strangling legacy systems, object-oriented and functional programming patterns, and finding metrics to drive technical decisions. This blog is place for me to give updates to what I&amp;amp;rsquo;m working on and learning, if you have questions, or concerns, feel free to message me. Also, find me on GitHub and LinkedIn.</content:encoded></item><item><title>Posts</title><link>/post/</link><dc:creator>TJ Maynes</dc:creator><guid>/post/</guid><description/><content:encoded></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
