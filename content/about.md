Hi, my name is TJ Maynes and Iâ€™m a Senior Software Engineer at VMware Pivotal Labs. I believe that agile software methodologies, such as pair programming, test-driven development and continuous delivery, are tools that help teams deliver valuable software to their customers.

I enjoy learning new software patterns and techniques, building automated CI/CD pipelines, and helping build high-velocity teams.

## Expertise
- I've worked on many different software projects ranging from static websites to backend services to iOS projects.
  - Some programming languages and frameworks I've worked with include: Kotlin/Spring, Typescript/React, Javascript/Nodejs, HTML/CSS, Clojure, Elixir, Python, and Golang.
- Test-driven development, pair programming and implementing inclusive mob programming sessions.
- Automating software delivery using tools like git, GNU Make, Bash scripts, Docker and Kubernetes.
- Automated testing strategies, such as e2e, integration and unit tests using tools like CypressJS, Jest, and Spring testing framework.
- Strangling legacy systems, object-oriented and functional programming patterns, and using metrics to drive technical decisions.

Currently, spending more time with Kubernetes and Go. Also, learning how to patch music on synthesizers.
