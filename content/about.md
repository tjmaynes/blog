Hi, my name is TJ Maynes and Iâ€™m a Senior Software Engineer at VMware Pivotal Labs. I believe that agile software methodologies, such as pair programming, test-driven development and continuous delivery help enable teams to deliver more impactful software solutions to their customers. I enjoy learning from others and care very deeply about building high-velocity teams.

## Expertise
- Full stack software development using tools like Python, Spring framework, Kotlin, Typescript/Javascript, React, Nodejs, HTML/CSS, and git.
- Test-driven development, pair programming and implementing inclusive mob programming sessions.
- Automating software delivery using tools like GNU Make, shell scripts, Docker and Kubernetes.
- Automated testing strategies, such as e2e, integration and unit tests using tools like CypressJS, Jest, and Spring testing framework.
- Strangling legacy systems, object-oriented and functional programming patterns, and using metrics to drive technical decisions.

Currently, spending more time learning Site Reliability Engineering techinques, Kubernetes and the Spring ecosystem.
