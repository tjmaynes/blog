Hi, my name is TJ Maynes and Iâ€™m a Senior Software Engineer [@VMwareTanzuLabs](https://twitter.com/vmwaretanzulabs). I'm interested in Spring/Java, Kubernetes, Go, Nix, and Cryptocurrency.

Currently, I'm working more closely in the Spring Cloud ecosystem, working on passing the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam, and planning a wedding.

This blog is place for me to give updates on things I'm learning, if you have questions, or concerns, feel free to [message me](mailto:tj@tjmaynes.com). Also, you can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/tjmaynes) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tjmaynes).
